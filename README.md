# BetterAtCode

I have always felt that I can't get better at algorithms, but a recent read of CLRS has made me think otherwise. I think algorithms are actually quite fun, and leetcode 
seems to be one of the ways to practice fun , sometimes frustrating problems. But this does not mean this directory is about Leetcode. It's rather about my journey
of getting better at programming.
